# MyREAD

MyREAD is a simple Book Tracking App.

## Reason behind

This project was made as a task for [EgyptFWD] grant. Its purpose is to test
my skills in using React, Managing the State, Understanding Lifecycle Events, and using Routing.

## Starting template

[Udacity] supplied us with a [starter template], however, this project was created from scratch using `create-react-app`.
So things might be different here, I tried to get the maximum outcome of this project by using new things like Hooks, Context, and Sass.
The documentation of each of these was my best friend along the way.
